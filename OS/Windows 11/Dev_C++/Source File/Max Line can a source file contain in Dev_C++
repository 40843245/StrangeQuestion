The question is 
What is the maximum number of lines can a source file contain in Dev_C++?
(I use Windows 11)

I've tried it and the answer is amazing
14160001.
When the Dev-C++ contains a source file with 14160001 lines, 
there is a bug occurs in Dev-C++.
Saying Out Of Memory.
(More details on the figure in Github.)

(P.S. I did NOT spend too long time to solve this question by myself.
I just copy and paste more.
Such as copy 1 line and paste 1 line then copy 2 lines and paste 2 lines etc.
Thus, I did NOT copy and paste many times and it did NOT take too long.
However, when I paste it, the Dev-C++ spends several minutes to paste.)
