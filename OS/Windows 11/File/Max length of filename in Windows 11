The question is
What is the maximum char of file name can we have in Windows 11?

When I try to solve the previous question, I came up with this question and I'm curious.
Thus, I try to solve this question by myself.

In my notebook, I can build 242-char long in "C:\". The directory total holds 245 chars (I use Microsoft Word to get the word count.)

I've tried to create a folder in C:\.
C:\qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm_qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm_qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm_qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm_qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm_qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm_qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm_qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm_qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm

However, when I google it, I found manyn different answers.
It amazes me.
