The question is 
How many top-level folders in Windows 11?
(i.e. Recall that in Windows 11, files and folders can be represented as a tree.
Starting from the C:/ disk, if we create subfolder using the following rule.
Step 1:
Initialize the current directory as C:/
Step 2:
Create a folder in the current directory.
Step 3:
Go to the folder you just created and set the current directory as the folder you just created.
Step 4:
Go to step 2
until the OS don't allow you to create a folder.

How many folders can we create?
)

The answer is suprising 128.
(I think the answer is between 10 to 20.)

The OS teacher asks the students this question in class.
Thus, I try to solve this question by myself.

But when I create 22 folders, I feel its too boring and I think I will spend lots of time to find the answer.
Thus, I google it.
In the website (the following link), there are some people ask the similar question and 
someone answers 128 top-level folders.
